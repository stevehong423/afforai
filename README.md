This is Steve Hong!  Thank you for letting me work on this assessment.  I included as much content from the landing
page as I could in the past 48 hours.  I noticed there were quite a few
sections of the landing page that were very similar to one another (for example, half text half image designs).  
I included those, but I also wanted to include other sections that had a diverse range of logic and functionality, 
such as the FAQ section.  

I sectioned off the areas of the landing page into different components, ranging from NavBar, FAQ, Dashboard, etc.
Thank you again!
